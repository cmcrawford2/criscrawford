                        <p>Here you will find some of my recent work in web page and app design. Since the end of December 2020, I've learned HTML, CSS,
                            Javacript, and JS React. I use VS Code, github, and netlify. I'm currently studying machine learning and ML ops, but
                            my one true love is geometry in all its manifestations. For 22 years I designed surface modeling algorithms for computer-aided design systems. I also love puzzles and colors.</p>

                        <h4>What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: "This life
                            as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be
                            nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great
                            in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence - even this spider and this
                            moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside
                            down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!"
                            Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus?... Or how well disposed
                            would you have to become to yourself and to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal
                            confirmation and seal?

                        <p>I love solving cryptograms on paper, and I insist on using a pen rather than a pencil. So either I get it right
                            from the start, or I have an inky mess. So when my friend Dan Fishman suggested I write a game, I immediately thought
                            of a helpful formatted cryptogram app that lets me try out different solutions. There are a couple dozen cryptograms included. While researching other cryptogram sites, I became stumbled across one in particular
                            that was very addictive. My goal in writing this was to make a non-addictive game. Therefore, entering the guess
                            letters requires some work, there's no prize at the end, and the number of provided quotes is limited. But it's still a lot of fun.</p>

                        <p>I was motivated to write this app after I saw a similar grid of colors sorted alphabetically, and then sorted naively
                            by red first, then green, then blue. I thought I could do better, but I soon learned that sorting colors is a
                            thorny problem. Visual media companies that need to determine color brightness apply different weights to the red, green and blue components of light to compute a brightness
                            value. In this app, the user can rearrange the colors using drag and drop functionality and invoke a numerical
                            method that will come up with a different set of weights based on the user's idea of light and dark.</p>

                        <p>This is a work in progress, so no link yet. With this app I'm reliving my glory days as a student of electrical
                            engineering. This career consisted of exactly two semesters of Laboratory Electronics at the Harvard Extension School.
                            During the second semester, we built a computer on a breadboard with chips and wires using the Motorola 68004 microprocessor. I
                            wrote a program for this computer to generate Penrose tiling patterns on an oscilloscope display. At first I wrote machine language
                            instructions directly onto a programmable ROM. When things got complicated, I switched to an assembly language translator.
                            Previously I had written a similar program in Postscript that output Penrose tiling patterns to
                            a laser printer. This is basically the same algorithm, except the language is Javascript React and the output is to
                            a web page.</p>
